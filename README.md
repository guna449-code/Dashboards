This Power BI report provides an interactive overview of sales performance across multiple dimensions, helping users quickly understand where revenue is coming from and how it is trending over time.

**Overview**
1.The top section includes slicers for Ship Mode and City, allowing users to filter the entire report by delivery method and location for focused analysis.
2.All visuals on the page are interconnected, so changing a slicer dynamically updates every chart to reflect the selected context.

**Sales distribution**
1. “Sales by Region” is shown as a pie chart that highlights the contribution of each region (West, East, Central, South) to total sales, along with both absolute values and percentages.
2. “Sales by Category” presents sales for key product categories (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies) as a line chart, making it easy to compare category performance and identify the highest‑revenue category.

**Customer and geographic insights**
1. “Sales by Segment” uses horizontal bar charts to break down sales by customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), emphasizing which segment drives the most revenue.
2. “Sales by State” is a filled/bubble map of the United States that visualizes sales geographically, helping to spot high- and low-performing states at a glance.

**Time-series analysis**
1. “Orders by Year and Month” is a line chart that tracks order count over time, enabling users to see seasonality, growth trends, and spikes in demand at the month level.
2. Data labels on the line chart show exact order counts for key points, which is useful for highlighting peaks and comparing performance between periods.
